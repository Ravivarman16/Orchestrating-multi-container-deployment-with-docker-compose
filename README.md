# ORCHESTRATING MULTI-CONTAINER DEPLOYMENT WITH DOCKER-COMPOSE

## PROBLEM-STATEMENT

Organizing and deploying multiple containers for an application can be a complex and time-consuming task. Coordinating different services on various ports manually poses challenges in efficiency and scalability.

## USE-CASE-SCENARIO

Imagine a scenario where you have developed a web application that comprises multiple services, each serving a distinct function. From user authentication to data processing, these services need to communicate seamlessly. Using Docker Compose to deploy these containers on specific ports simplifies the orchestration process, ensuring that your application runs smoothly and is easily accessible.

## TASKS TO BE PERFORMED

- Create 5 custom containers with 5 different default pages.
- Using Docker Compose, deploy these 5 containers on **port 8000, 8080, 9000, 9090, and 5000** respectively.

## SOLUTION

### PRE-REQUIREMENTS

- **Cloud:** AWS
- **Web-server:** Apache & Nginx
- **Containerization:** Docker
- **Orchestration:** Docker-Compose
